# Hi, I'm Kennan.

## Personal Stuff

I started programming on calculators with TI-BASIC back in high school,
and I've been addicted ever since.
Outside of my studies, I'm an avid cyclist, musician, linux enthusiast.

Prior to college, I was an active competitor in the
Rubik's Cube speedsolving community. During the years when I was actively competing,
[my highlights](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013LEJE03) included a North American Record, 90 podium finishes,
and a top rank of 12th globally for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube.

## Academic Stuff

I recently earned my MS in Computer Science with my
thesis titled "Dynamic Structure Adaptation for Communities of Learning Machines".
In my work, I investigated knowledge propagation in networked learning systems,
and developed several dynamic optimization methods to accelerate the average learning
rate of agents in a network.

## Professional Stuff

Now, I'm a Software Engineer at the
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where I work on
machine learning research for automated biological threat
assessment and full stack software engineering with Angular and Java Spring.

Some of the tools I've used include:

- Python with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras to design, train, and evaluate machine learning models to solve research problems
- Svelte, Angular, Vue for front end development
- Node.js, FastAPI, Python Flask for backend development
- Terraform, Ansible, and Nix for declarative cloud resource management
- UNIX scripting with `awk` and `bash` for task automation and prototyping data processing
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and `nix` package manager for fully reproducible deployment and [declarative system management](https://github.com/kclejeune/system)
